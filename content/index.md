---


## Introduction  
**CoRN (Cooperative Research Notes)** is an initiative to enhance collaboration and streamline research documentation in the field of **Privacy and Applied Cryptography**. This repository serves as a structured and efficient way to record research ideas, experiments, discussions, and progress.  

Currently, CoRN is in its early stages, being developed as a foundation for a more structured research collaboration system. The goal is to create a seamless and interactive way for researchers to document and share their insights before integrating it into a broader research environment.  

## ğŸ”¥ Objectives  
1. **Structured Research Documentation** â€“ Organizing research discussions, experiments, and findings systematically.  
2. **Facilitating Collaboration** â€“ Creating a transparent and efficient way to share knowledge within a research group.  
3. **Tracking Progress** â€“ Maintaining a clear history of research directions and development.
