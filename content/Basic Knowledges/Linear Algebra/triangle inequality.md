$$
|| \texttt{a} + \texttt{b} || \le || \texttt{a} || + || \texttt{b} ||
$$

## Proof
$$
\begin{aligned}
|| \texttt{a} + \texttt{b} ||^2 &= || \texttt{a} ||^2 + 2<\texttt{a}, \texttt{b}> + ||\texttt{b}||^2 \\
&\le ||\texttt{a}||^2 + 2||\texttt{a}|| \cdot ||\texttt{b}|| + ||\texttt{b}||^2 (\because \text{Cauchy-Schwarz inequality}) \\
&= (||\texttt{a}|| + ||\texttt{b}||)^2
\end{aligned}
$$
